# SpreeCashOnDelivery

This gem provides Cash on Delivery payment method for spree. Works with spree  >= 1.2.

Ps.
This gem has no tests (yet) – which I’m not proud of.
It’s because I don’t know spree very well, plus I didn’t have enough time, so feel free to fork it and create test suite for this gem.
